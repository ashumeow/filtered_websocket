    Filtered WebSocket is a straight forward framework for implementing websocket servers which draws inspiration from UNIX process pipelines.
    It's a metaphor for: cat server_event | behavior_a | behavior_b | ...
    Server event handlers are encapsulated within filters such that building elaborate behaviors is as easy as importing new modules.
    Imported filters automatically add themselves to an appropriate filter chain (pipeline).

    - Supports SSL
    - Scales horizontally via remote backend storage (redis) and pubsub
      handling
    - Supports token based auth
    - New behaviors are added by simply importing filter modules""",
